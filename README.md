# YBI Project 1 - Prediction of cement compressive strength

YBI is a company which provide a good quality of resources and programs to enhance the skills of a programmer who eager to learn some set of skill. This platform is very good in term of cost, lectures, material and aslo the projects. <br>

I took some courses from here to enhance my knowledge in the field of Data science and did my first ever project.<br>

Prediction of cement compressive strength is a model which is based on Regression model, Here we predict that how much is the compressive strength of the particular cement has with variety of mixtures of its component. The dataset for this prediction contain variety of items such as the various composition of the cement and the days in which its compressivity increases or decreases.



## Way of implementing the model
1. Importing different libraries and Dataset
2. Exploring the Dataset
3. Visualizing the Dataset
4. Separating the dataset as feature and target data
5. Creating the Regression model
6. Evaluation, error finding and prediction
